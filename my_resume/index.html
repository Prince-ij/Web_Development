    <h3>Summary</h3>

        Coding has been my passion ever since I learnt about it. I keep exploring and learning while using my skills to build and solve
        real world problems. I love programming, precisely because it makes me think, allows me to be creative and let's me try out
        new things.</p>
    <p>
        My goal is to be a successful Software Engineer dedicated to building and crafting solutions with my skills, and touching the
        lives of people in the process. <br />
        My motto: Humility, Patience and Hardwork.
